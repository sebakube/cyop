# The script and the notebook should automatically download the required datasets from my google drive as they were too big to publish them in my github repository. To download them a google account is required. 


If this does not work or is not acceptable the datasets can be downloaded from kaggle (kaggle account required):

.


The respective code chunk in the notebook and the section of the script describe what needs to be done in order to load the downloaded files from the working directory.
